# React Random Color Generator

Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

[ ] Read the Breaking Down Tasks Into TODOs page on the Learning Platform
[ ] Create a `Generate` button
[ ] create a div that contains text `Generated Color: <background color hex code> `
[ ] pressing the generate button should generate a new color
[ ] div should take the generated color as background color

    Our suggestions for breaking down the task into TODOs:

If you need a reminder of how we did this last week, watch the video showing breaking down tasks
This time, you will need to think about design in the browser: Design the web app with a tool like Figma or by sketching the design out on paper
Come up with a detailed list of features you'll need for the application above
For each of the features, write which dependencies, functions and React component(s) you'll need for them, if any
Describe how each component will interact with the other components
Identify any unknowns
